            <div class="anecdote">
                <p>
                    I was six years old, living in Las Vegas, Nevada.  My parents had 
                    just gotten divorced and each of them decided to move back to New 
                    York City, New York.  My dad moved to Canarsie, at the time a mostly 
                    middle class neighborhood, while my mother moved to an area near Coney 
                    Island Avenue, a mix of mostly low to medium-low income housing.  
                    The courts had decided that my sister and I were going to be better 
                    off in the custody of my mother, even though I remember wanting to 
                    live with my dad, so that is where we ended up.  It seems the courts 
                    don&lsquo;t take the word of a child very seriously, and somehow 
                    assume that in a single parent home, mothers are going to be better 
                    at parenting than the father might be.  In the case of my mother, 
                    however, this was not the case. Although my life was influenced 
                    to a great degree by her lack of &lsquo;mothering&lsquo;, the thing 
                    that I remember the most, and that has probably caused me the most 
                    problems in my life wasn&lsquo;t her bad parenting at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1402, avenue k, Brooklyn, New York.  That is where my building was; 
                    it was in a bad neighborhood, on a bad street.  It was one in a line 
                    of about six or seven buildings, each taking up a full city block.  
                    Each building was six stories tall, and each one more dilapidated 
                    than the other.  I lived in perhaps the worst of them.  Well at 
                    least I had assumed it was the worst of them.  I was never actually 
                    inside the other buildings and could only go by what I had seen 
                    from the outside.  But I was six and well, my building just had 
                    to be the worst.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the building might have looked good fifty years ago, 
                    but now the only term I can use to describe the building was 
                    slum.  The old red bricks, once brilliant and clean, were now 
                    dingy and starting to crumble.  Many of the windows were broken; 
                    some were even covered with boards instead of having been repaired.  
                    The main entrance was also disgusting, filled with trash and other 
                    things that you shouldn&lsquo;t see outside a building.  There 
                    was so much feces at the entrance that I became paranoid about 
                    stepping in it, forcing me to walk with my head down instead of 
                    looking where I was going.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inside was no better; it was as neglected as the outside, 
                    so as you might imagine, since the outside was so horrible I 
                    was miserable.  And the worst part of it all?  I was forced 
                    to stay indoors almost constantly for the next five years.  
                    The next five years.  Probably the worst five years of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now obviously, as you can probably tell, I experienced no 
                    joy where I lived.  After all, what child would want to 
                    live in a slum-like tenement?  But even with all the filth 
                    and dilapidation, around me during my childhood, one thing 
                    stood out more than the rest.  As I said earlier, the building 
                    was old, practically a slum.  It also happened to be the perfect 
                    breeding ground for roaches.  Now I know that most of you 
                    probably &lsquo;love&lsquo; the little critters; the way 
                    they crawl up and down the walls, how they fill your kitchen 
                    sinks and dishes, even the way they hide among your forks and 
                    knives in a drawer.  But me on the other hand, I have to admit 
                    that I have no love for them.  In a world ruled by human beings, 
                    my life was ruled by roaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first time I saw one of the little brown beasts I didn&lsquo;t 
                    know what they were.  It was about half an inch long with a dull 
                    brown body.  Its tiny eyes were attached to a rather disgusting 
                    looking head, even for a bug, which ended in two long antenna.  
                    Even its legs were gross.  Hairy and long they looked somewhat 
                    like those of a cricket but at the same time different.  When 
                    I asked my mother what it was, she told me it was a roach and 
                    then proceeded to kill it with either bug spray or a shoe.  Or 
                    maybe it was a paper towel or newspaper.  The truth is, there 
                    were numerous ways to kill the little guys and you just used 
                    what was close by at the time.  After she killed it, I didn&lsquo;t 
                    really think much of it, and at first, I only found them to be a 
                    minor annoyance.  But after a while, I began to notice more of 
                    them.  At first it was only a few, but then it was a dozen, 
                    then more.  A realization came with their numbers.  I lived in 
                    their apartment.  They did not live in mine.  It was bad enough 
                    that three people (my mother, my sister and I) had to share the 
                    small one bedroom, but it was worse to find out that we were not 
                    the only tenants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite things to do was to wake up early on a Saturday 
                    to watch the early morning cartoons.  I&lsquo;d sit on the floor 
                    after making a bowl of cereal, turn on the volume really low, and 
                    watch the Superfriends or whatever else might be on at six or seven 
                    am.  Unfortunately, unlike other children who did the same thing 
                    with their siblings, I had other company.  It didn&lsquo;t really 
                    take long before my friends would come out to watch with me.  It 
                    might be only one or two of the hairy-winged bastards, but it was 
                    usually more.  They brought their friends.  They brought their 
                    families.  Even their distant relatives seemed to come to join the 
                    fun.  And oh how fun that was!  Little ones the size of a letter 
                    on this page, big ones, almost an inch long, with their large antennae 
                    flicking back and forth along the ground; all of them came for the fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, for them anyway, most of them died a quick death 
                    under a nearby shoe.  (I always kept a shoe close by when I sat
                    on the floor to watch television)  Although at first this was only 
                    a somewhat annoying, as time progressed, it got worse.  Each day 
                    seemed to bring out more roaches.  Each week more of them made 
                    themselves at home.  The apartment, as time went on, became infested 
                    with them.  And with this infestation, my problem started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am not sure of the exact day or week that it really began to 
                    bother me, but eventually rather than being merely annoyed by them, 
                    I began to fear them.  Not a fear like that of being eaten alive by 
                    a shark, or even the fear of heights many people have.  No.  This 
                    fear was more of a fear of the unexpected, kind of like the fear 
                    people have of spiders, but much, much worse.  I started to dread 
                    killing them.  The feel of their bodies being smashed in a paper towel, 
                    the sound of them popping as their bodies burst apart and making popping 
                    sounds made me cringe.  Seeing half of a body, ripped apart on the ground, 
                    or on the wall would make me gag to the point where I might vomit.  Each 
                    roach brought more death, more hideous sounds and more torn apart bodies.  
                    Each death increased in me, a fear that I could not understand.  They 
                    were just roaches after all.  Or were they?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apparently, for me at least they were not just roaches.  For me, they 
                    were a nightmare.  They purposely walked around the apartment just to 
                    find me.  They would torment me.  If I wanted to eat, I would find them 
                    on my spoon when I pulled it from a drawer.  They were in my cereal, 
                    in my bowl.  When I went to sleep, I could see them on the walls, 
                    staring down into my eyes, waiting for me to close them so that they 
                    could attack me.  Eventually I had to resort to making a cocoon out 
                    of my blankets so that they couldn&lsquo;t get to me.  I would wrap 
                    my blanket so tightly around my body that I would wake in the middle 
                    of the night soaking wet from the heat.  But this wasn’t even the worst of 
                    it.  No.  The worst of it was that time in the night that I would wake up 
                    and have to use the bathroom.  Sure, they were in the bedroom and the kitchen, 
                    in the living room and in the hall.  But the one place I dreaded to go, 
                    the one place they lurked most often in the dark, the one place I knew I 
                    could not escape them, was the bathroom.  This is where I knew they waited.  
                    Everyone was asleep.  They would torment me well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dark as pitch, I would walk ever so slowly on my tiptoes in hopes that 
                    with less of my feet on the ground, I might avoid stepping on them.  
                    Sometimes I made it.  Most of the time I didn&lsquo;t.  When I didn&lsquo;t, 
                    what I would feel can only be described as dread.  The body of a roach, 
                    smashed against or even between my toes.  I couldn&lsquo;t stand it.  
                    I would freak out.  I would try to get to the bathroom as fast as possible 
                    to turn on the light.  I would step on more, causing me to panic and shake.  
                    The light would save me.  They hated the light.  They would run from it.  
                    The light would save me.  But as the blessed light went on, I would see it, 
                    their army,  hundreds of them.  Scattering like blown sand, they would be 
                    everywhere.  Into the cracks they would run.  Up the walls.  Towards me.  
                    I panicked even more.  Jumping and hopping I would lean against the wall 
                    in order to avoid them.  I probably looked like some kind of contortionist, 
                    the way I was bending and moving.  For good reason.  I was terrified.  If 
                    too many came my way, I would jump over them, hoping to land on a clean 
                    spot on the floor.  More often than not, I just landed on more roaches.  
                    More often than not, my fears just made the situation worse.  I would kill 
                    more than I avoided.  In my panic I had no control.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, after what seemed like forever, I would finally make my way inside the 
                    bathroom.  I had to check the sink.  I checked the walls.  I even looked up 
                    at the ceiling.  I had to check the toilet basin to make sure there were none 
                    hiding in the bowl.  I looked around it.  Under it.  Inside it.  It was torture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And every night it was the same ordeal.  Use the bathroom or avoid the roaches.  
                    It was a battle I had to fight every night for five years.  I became paranoid.  
                    Obsessive.  I became a different person because of a bug.  Because of an insect, 
                    I couldn&lsquo;t enjoy my life.  Eventually I couldn&lsquo;t even use the bathroom 
                    anymore.  I would pee on the radiator in the bedroom to avoid them.  It would 
                    stink when the heat was on.  But I didn&lsquo;t care.  I didn&lsquo;t want to be 
                    near them.  The strangest thing?  My mother never asked me why the radiator 
                    smelled like pee.  She had to have noticed the smell didn&lsquo;t she?  What 
                    normal person wouldn’&lsquo;t?  But perhaps that was part of my problem.  My 
                    mother wasn’t normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some five years after my ordeal began, when I was about eleven years old, my 
                    father seized custody of my sister and I, sparing me any more torture.
                    Little did I know however, the effect those years would have on the rest of 
                    my life.  I have since become extremely uncomfortable around any insects that 
                    crawl around.  Whether spiders or beetles, roaches or ants, the discomfort I 
                    feel when I come across one unexpectantly is unpleasant to say the least.  
                    To this day I cannot step on anything that looks like a roach without it 
                    bringing back horrible memories.  And when I do by accident, I cringe just 
                    as I did as a child.  I remember living in Los Angeles when I was around 
                    twenty seven.  I was walking down the street one evening and nearly stepped 
                    on a roach.  From that point on I had to look down as I walked, though I 
                    tried to avoid the darker, unlit areas where they might be.  To my aunt and 
                    uncle I looked ridiculous.  They even made fun of me a little when they saw 
                    how I would avoid stepping on them.  But to me?  To me it was different.  It 
                    took me back to the time when I was living in that apartment and I feel like 
                    I did when I was a child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am convinced that this is what started me on the road to developing obsessive 
                    compulsive disorder.  I know it is a phobia.  I know the reason I have it.  
                    I have even tried to cure it by facing my fear.  But nothing I do works.  So 
                    I take each day as it comes and I try not to worry about that aspect of my life so much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But to this day, if I feel an itching on my leg when I am laying in bed, I 
                    can&lsquo;t help but wonder if it might be a roach.  Then I ask myself.  Are 
                    all my fears and anxiety worth it?  Should I really 
                    be, &lsquo;<em>Scared of a Cockroach</em>&lsquo;?

                                time during the struggle, but the future will be better for it.

                                I have doubted myself many times.  It only leads to fear of failure.  When I believe in
                                myself I succeed.  If I can be fearless, so can you!

                                When you're stressed, remember to breathe.  Many times during panic attacks, I
                                have stopped to breathe.  It almost always calms me to clarity.

                    <p> So here are are.  It is Sunday, March 15th and we as a city and a nation
                        for that matter are panicking.  I am not saying that we should not be 
                        cautious, we should.  However, as someone who is prone to bouts of anxiety
                        and panic attacks, I for one am in the opinion that how we are reacting
                        is not good for the greater good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I went to the local Target last night and there was nothing on any of the
                        shelves in the medical aisles.  Shelves that once held tissues, cough medicines,
                        alcohol, and sanitizer were wiped clean.  I almost laughed as I saw the shelves
                        because I didn't know what to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My dad, who is 76 years old needed hydrogen peroxide because he constantly
                        cuts himself due to thin skin and veins close to the surface.  Because of
                        people hording supplies, my dad, who actually needs it, has to go without
                        an important item in his medicine chest.  This, all because people are buying
                        more than they actually need instead of just being cautious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even my stepmother, who is 80 years old, is overacting.  She actually called
                        me to tell me to buy alcohol from the liquor store to use as a cleaner.  I
                        truly couldn't believe what I was hearing.  In her panic to keep the house
                        clean, she was willing to use a product (a very expensive one at that) to clean
                        the home.  The only problem?  Store bought alcohol, for the most part does not
                        have enough alcohol to kill the virus.  Except for maybe everyclear which
                        is over 90% alcohol, most store bought alcohols have less than 50% alcohol
                        content.  For context.  A beer has less than 10% alcohol in it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She isn't the only one who obviously is in a panic.  Many of my coworkers have
                        become nervous and are starting to debate going in to work.  This is a problem
                        since I work for a school and if teachers do not show up, then the entire plan
                        for kids to go to school is moot.  Something has to give.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even as I sit here, in a Starbucks coffee shop, I see people coming in, buying
                        their coffee, most of whom are talking about it.  They still come in to get
                        their drinks, but most leave quickly, not sitting down at the tables now spaced
                        6' apart from each other.  And yet, here I am.  I am not panicked.  I am concerned.
                        This is a bit of an interesting turn of events since I am normally one to have
                        high anxiety levels for less important things.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suddenly, a man starts hacking up coughing about 4 feet from me.  It is so 
                        loud and disturbing that I turn to him and look.  He continues to cough and 
                        it begins to make me nervous.  I debate leaving, as my anxiety levels begin
                        to rise and I worry that possibly he has the virus.  I feel the urge to leave
                        and go home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So what do I do?  I fight it.  I am going to finish this post and not be
                        scared to live my life.  I know in my mind that the virus will at most get
                        me very sick, and at least show few symptoms.  As someone with high anxiety
                        I will myself to live my life outside of fear.  I will stay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, for today.  I have won my battle with anxiousness and panic.  I fought
                        with my OCD to allow me to live my life as I normally do.  I urge you all,
                        when you begin to worry, as you will, to think about the effects that worry
                        will have on your life.  If we worry constantly, it will only affect us
                        in a negative way.  If we live our lives, and take things as they come, we
                        might run into problems, but we will always be able to find a solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that, I leave you for today.  Be well and remember.  You are your own
                        worst enemy, but you can also be your own best friend.  Until next time.
                        Carry on!
                    </p>
