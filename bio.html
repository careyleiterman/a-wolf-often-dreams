            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is Carey and I struggled with anxiety, OCD and some other mental
                illnesses.  Despite this, my life is filled with many other things.  I work
                full time in a school and help children, who like myself have their own
                challenges in their everyday lives.  I enjoy a variety of interests such 
                as reading and writing.  I also have pets and LOVE astronomy.  So to get
                to know me a bit and understand why I created this website, please read 
                on below.</p>

            <h3>Why Did I Create This Website?</h3>
            <p> I suppose you are wondering why I called this site, 'Scared of a Cockroach'.
                Well for starters I am scared of them and they really give me anxiety.  However,
                that is not the sole reason for the name.  I feel that in a website like this,
                there needs to be meaning behind it for people to be able to relate to it. 
                For me, roaches represent everything that this website represents.  They
                are something many people look at with disgust, fear, anxiety and panic; all things
                this website is about.  Therefore I felt it was a good name for the site.  There
                is a much more in depth story about my fear of roaches which you can read
                <a href="stories.html#cockroach">here.</a>          
            </p>
            <h3>My Struggles</h3>
            <p> I have long struggled with various forms of anxiety, OCD, and a variety
                of other mental illnesses.  Throughout my life, starting at the age of
                six years old I have struggled to fit in, be comfortable with myself, and 
                just be what everyone would classify as "normal".  I really didn't develop
                most of my symptoms until I was in my middle teen years, and most of them
                have lasted into adulthood.  Despite this I do have a relatively normal life
                and enjoy doing things just like anyone else.  It is tough sometimes but I
                do the best I can and for the most part have a good life.
            </p>
            
            <h3>My Job</h3>
            <p> During the week I have a full time job where I work with special needs
                children, a stressful yet rewarding job that I love doing.  Every day is 
                a new experience and I look forward to making a difference every times I 
                go to work.  Some days are more better than others, and some are downright
                stressful.  The children I work with range from emotionally disturbed to 
                autistic.  Each has their own needs and through helping them, it also helps
                me.  By working with these kids, I realize that everyone has their own
                struggles, so it gives me hope that I can win the fight against mine.  Overall
                it is a rewarding job and I look forward to making a difference in each life
                I come across.

            <h3>My Interests</h3>
            <p> Like most of you, I have a variety of interests.   First off, I
                love to read, especially the fantasy genre.  At any given time
                you can catch me sitting back and enjoying a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn" target="_blank">Mistborn</a> novel
                by <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com" target="_blank">Brandon Sanderson</a>
                or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time" target="_blank">Wheel of Time</a>
                series by the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jordan" target="_blank">
                Robert Jordan</a>.   
            </p>
     
            <p> Besides reading, I also enjoy writing.  I am currently working on two pieces.  One
                is a fantasy novel with a really cool magic system.  It is the typical sword and
                sorcery, epic fantasy novel that I hope to one day complete (if not publish)  I am
                also working on a personal memoir which is part of what gave me the idea for this
                website.  I've written many stories which I will include here as I continue my quest
                to write my life story.
            </p>
            <p> I also enjoy drawing and sometimes painting, though I am not so good
                with the brush as I am with a pencil!  I enjoy drawing landscapes and am
                working on faces right now.  I am starting to get really good at drawing
                eyes and I will post some of my work in the near future for anyone who is
                interested to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend a <em>lot</em> of time watching tv and movies.  I have a wide variety
                of tastes and a large digital and blu-ray collection.  Some of my favorites
                are <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/" target="_blank">Shawshank Redemption</a>,
                 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317740/" target="_blank">The Italian Job</a>, and
                 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/" target="_blank">Die Hard</a>.  I also
                 love almost all of the <a href="https://www.marvel.com/movies" target="_blank">MCU</a> movies.
                 On television I love the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/" target="_blank">The Big
                Bang Theory</a> and watch it pretty much every night.
            </p>

            <p> When I am not home I enjoy hiking, working out at the gym, and visiting
                different cultural areas of New York City.  Anything from a museum to
                the streets of <a href="https://www.timessquarenyc.org/">Times Square</a>
                is fair game.  Sometimes I will even head out to a 
                <a href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees">Yankees</a> game to root for
                them as they go for another title.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p> As you can probably tell from above, just like everyone else, I have
                days that are relatively good where I can enjoy myself and have fun.
                However, there are times where things don't feel so great and even days
                where I feel the world is going to end.  In other words: <strong>Life 
                can be a struggle!</strong>
            </p>
            <p> That is why I started this website.  My thoughts are that if I struggle
                on a weekly, daily, or even hourly basis; so might some of you.  It is my
                hope that through this site, I can bring together others who also struggle
                and through new friendships we might build ourselves stronger (and less
                stressful) lives.  Even if I can help just one person though my efforts
                it will be a success.  So if you're willing, come share your struggles
                with myself and anyone else who decides they want a change.
